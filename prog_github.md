DV360 is Googleâ€™s own demand side platform. A DSP is a technology platform used to buy and run programmatic advertising. 
Advertisers use a DSP to set preferences such as which audience characteristics to target, how much to spend for each ad that displays and what time of day to display their ads and others. 
The settings in DV360 are then used to connect with a wide range of publishers who can reach the specified audience, at the right cost. 
Ads are displayed across a variety of publishers who offer ad space on Google Ad Exchange (AdX) and other ad exchanges and networks to which DV360 has direct connections.
